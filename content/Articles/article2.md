I've visited auron once with my Grandma and my Grandpa and also my family. The ski slopes were very pleasant but I enjoyed skiing more in Cervinia. We stayd there for a week at a hotel in the village. The hotel was very nice and served delicious food. While in Auron we met a lot of Swedes that were on vacation at the same time as us. Overall I had a great experience and i could really recommend the place!

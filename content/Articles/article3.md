As far as I can remember i've always loved skiing. Since my grandparents own a cabin in sälen that's the place me and my family visit every year. Sälen consist of 4 different places to ski called Tandådalen, Hundjället, Lindvallen and Höjfjället. When I was younger my favourite was Hundfjället but now I like Tandådalen the most.

I've been to trysil a few time and I had a really good time. My grandparents have a cabin located in Sälen which me and my family visit every year. To get to trysil it's about an hour drive from the cabine. The ski slopes is a bit better compared to the ones in Sälen since they are longer and got more natural snow on them.
